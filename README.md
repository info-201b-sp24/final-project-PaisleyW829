# Introduction
This project would be aiming on the trends and determinants of teenage pregnancy rates in each state in the US, we are focusing on teens between the ages of 15 and 19 years old. By discovering and pairing to different abortion laws and educational conditions in each state, the goal is to reveal the correlation between these factors and the rate of teenage pregnancy. As social attitudes toward teen pregnancy become more critical, we believe there is necessary to explore deeper in this social situation. Teenage pregnancy would bring out lots of negative results, for example, affecting teenagers' mental development and physical health etc. We plan to utilize up-to-date and dynamic data from the recent decade to ensure that our research is relevant and current. This approach will allow us to further explore how different laws and educations affect teenage mental and physical health. In addition, we hope the project can highlight broader implications for public health and social policy, providing improvements for the development of targeted interventions and solutions. By identifying the key factors that influence teen pregnancy rates, our project aims call on action for policymakers to develop effective strategies to address this challenging social issue. Overall, our main goal is to provide actionable solutions that could help in reduce the teen pregnancy rates, thus improving and ensuring the well-being of teenagers across the United States.


# Conclusion / Summary Takeaways
Based on our analysis of teenage pregnancy, we identified key determinants that influence teenage pregnancy rates among teenagers. In order to mitigate this social issue, we propose several solutions to lower teenage pregnancy rate.

## Possible effective solutions include:
Takeaways 1:

Based on the analysis of the data analyses, we found the Average US teen pregnancy rate. According to the data exposed in the recent few decades teen pregnancy rates have been dragged down and decreased. For instance, in respect of the period from 2000-2020, ever of the teen pregnancy rate has decreased each year. In that, from 62 percent in 1990-1991, in 2019-2020 it has decreased to 18.1 percent. Depending on these successful elements some education and interventions that have been proceeded or organized in the past helped to decrease the teenage pregnancy rate in any way.
Despite the overall positive trend, there are significant differences in teen pregnancy rates between states. The 2019-2020 teen pregnancy rate was 14.1 in California and 12.7 in New York, but 26.3 in Mississippi and 24.8 in Alabama. California and New York have significantly lower teen pregnancy rates than some southern states such as Mississippi and Alabama. This disparity reflects differences in sex education policies across states, access to contraception, and cultural and socioeconomic factors. Comparing policies and outcomes in different states can provide a reference for policy improvements across the country.

Takeaways 2:

Further analysis showed that teen pregnancy rates are not determined by a single factor but by many social factors. For example, states with higher rates of teen pregnancy tend to have higher rates of poverty and lower levels of education. These findings suggest that in addition to direct sex education and contraception, improving overall socioeconomic status is an important way to reduce teen pregnancy rates.
Our most important insight from this analysis is that comprehensive sex education and widespread access to contraception play a key role in reducing teen pregnancy rates. However, these measures alone are not enough, and socio-economic factors such as poverty and education levels also need to be taken into account and addressed. This insight highlights the need for policymakers to take a multi-layered, multi-dimensional approach when designing interventions. We suggest ways to further reduce the teen pregnancy rate.

Solutions we think of:

1. Implement comprehensive and accurate sex education curricula in schools, including contraception, prevention and control of sexually transmitted diseases, sexual consent, etc. Educate adolescents on how to make informed sexual decisions, including rejecting unsafe sex and recognizing potential risks. Comprehensive sex education can help adolescents make safer and more responsible sexual decisions.
2. Increase the availability of contraceptive knowledge and resources. Provide free or low-cost contraceptive tools and information through schools, community health centers, and online platforms. Accessible counseling: Professional sexual health counseling services are available so that young people can find support if they need help or advice.
3. Encourage parents to have an open and honest dialogue with their children and improve parents' knowledge and communication skills about sex education. In addition, building community support networks to increase awareness and prevention of teenage pregnancy through events and workshops.
4. Develop and implement policies that support the health and rights of adolescents, such as ensuring the quality and coverage of sex education curricula in schools and ensuring the teenagers have adequate funding to use contraceptives. There is a legal need to ensure the protection of adolescents' right to privacy when accessing contraceptive and counseling services.

Takeaways 3:

The broad implications of our analysis are that it applies not only to reducing teen pregnancy rates, but also to other public health issues. By integrating educational, economic and health considerations, more effective public health policies can be designed. Such multidimensional strategies can achieve health improvements across a wider population, thereby enhancing overall social well-being.
With these specific analyses and insights, we can provide strong support and recommendations for future policy development and interventions to help further reduce teen pregnancy rates and improve adolescent health in the United States.
