By discovering and pairing to different abortion laws and educational conditions in each state, the goal is to reveal the correlation between these factors and the rate of teenage pregnancy. As social attitudes toward teen pregnancy become more critical, we believe there is necessary to explore deeper in this social situation. Teenage pregnancy would bring out lots of negative results, for example, affecting teenagers' mental development and physical health etc. We plan to utilize up-to-date and dynamic data from the recent decade to ensure that our research is relevant and current. This approach will allow us to further explore how different laws and educations affect teenage mental and physical health. In addition, we hope the project can highlight broader implications for public health and social policy, providing improvements for the development of targeted interventions and solutions. By identifying the key factors that influence teen pregnancy rates, our project aims call on action for policymakers to develop effective strategies to address this challenging social issue. Overall, our main goal is to provide actionable solutions that could help in reduce the teen pregnancy rates, thus improving and ensuring the well-being of teenagers across the United States."),

Secondly, designers can design and improve teenage health education publicity materials according to the research results, making them more attractive and easy to understand, and increasing the participation and acceptance of adolescents. In addition, designers can work with educational institutions and community organizations to develop innovative educational games, apps, or virtual reality experiences that stimulate youth interest and engagement in health issues, thereby promoting an understanding of sex education. Also, the research results could provide important references for developing more direct and efficient policy measures to reduce teenage pregnancy rates and ensure the teenage health. For example, the government can adjust the content and scope of youth sex education courses, increase the popularity and accessibility of family planning services, and formulate stricter policies for teen childbirth.")
